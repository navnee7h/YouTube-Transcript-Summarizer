system free Up Storage secure thingsare kind of scattered everywhere the newpc manager changes that honestly afterwatching this video you'll be like okayI want this on my PC now I will show youthe new windows 11 manager in action butbefore we begin if you're someone whocomes across a lot of PDF files you needwondershare PDF element which is a fasteasy to use PDF tool on phones desktopand even the

of batch edits onmultiple PDF files at once which is veryhandy the best thing though is how easyPDF element is to use so go ahead andcheck out wondershare PDF element fromthe link below right now okay so let'sget to the point now this is the new pcmanager running on a Windows 11 laptopand just to give you an idea this can beused on both windows 11 as well as aWindows 10 PC now I'll tell you how youcan get this on your laptop or PC butfirst let me show you how this works soas you can see the new pc manager hasmultiple options there are two tabscleanup and security and the cleanup tabshows you the memory usage and thetemporary files in your PC along withthe Boost button there's also healthcheck storage management ProcessManagement startup apps the security tabis where you'll find the Windows updatebrowser protection and pop-up managementso a PC manager basically brings all ofthe important options and settings alongwith some extra features in just oneplace and that is very useful but theimportant question is does this actuallywork well the answer is yes look firstup the Boost button quickly reduces RAMusage and frees up temporary files fromyour system and it actually makes a gooddifference I can hit boost and the RAMusage goes down by almost 20 percentalso add around 4GB of temporary filesthat are now gone this is good and thiswill specially come in handy for budgetlaptops that are low on RAM and storagein fact after using the Boost button wedid feel like this experience was alittle smoother so yeah it makesdifference now the Boost button removestemporary files but if you want to freeup more storage remove more files thehealth check option lets you do thatalong with temp files it lets you cleanbrowser cache system logs recent filelist it also shows you startup apps youshould disable and potential issueswhich is practically an ad it says resetdefault browser to Edge because I've setit to Chrome and I mean Edge is actuallygood but this constant pressure byMicrosoft is just annoying now anywayalso free up some more storage using theDeep cleanup option in the storagemanager it lets you remove unneededWindows update files Windows prefetchfiles Defender logs cache from DirectXdelivery optimization files and webcache see basically using the PC manageryou can get rid of all types ofdifferent unnecessary files be temporaryfiles browser cache system logs Windowsupdate files DirectX cache all in oneplace I mean there's no need to go todifferent pages and different options toremove these files and that's what makesthis very useful right but but myfavorite feature is this the ability tofind big files easily see a lot of timesI have downloaded big files saved in myPC and kind of forgot about them this iswhere I've used tools like resize tofind the big files easily and deletethem this option manage large files doesexactly that as you can see I can sortthe files by their sizes and I can alsolook for different file types so justselect all which is what I prefer onceagain I can view the large files in fileexplorer select these files just deletethem to free up a lot of space this isactually very handy now the storagemanagement also has shortcuts to quicklytake you to the apps list so that youcan uninstall apps you might not beusing and there's also a shortcut tostorage sense which is an option thatautomatically deletes recycle bin filesand also unopened files in the downloadsfolder anyway along with the fact thatPC manager has the Boost button whichworks that reduces RAM usage I like thatit has a Process Management page whereyou can kill unused processes to speedup your system I mean killing the McAfeeprocess makes sense right I can alsodisable startup apps because I can alsosee the impact on the ram they have atthe startupso that was all about the cleanup tabbut there's also the security tab whichis basically your one stop for all thewindows security features I mean there'sWindows Defender integrated right hereso you can start a quick scan right awaythere's Windows update browserprotection which works with Edge as wellas Chrome and Firefox and then alsopop-up management which basically blocksapps from opening any annoying Windowslook the reason I found the new pcmanage is so useful is because itsimplifies the whole process of cleaningyour system I mean I always forget todelete unnecessary big files disabledprograms that are taking up RAM andthese do affect the day-to-dayperformance and PC manager solves thatlook this is making the WindowsExperience better and with this I don'thave to spend too much time going intodifferent options and settings manuallyto do these useless tasks there is nolonger any to open Windows settings taskmanager disk cleanup Windows Defender oranything else all I need to do is openthis click a button or two and it takescare of the rest which is what makesthis awesome now I know what you'rethinking how do I use this how do I getthis on my PC and use it well it's
